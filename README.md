## Case Study Repository

The case studies are put into their own folders to separate them.

### Star Wars Character of the Day

This case study can be found in `swcotd`. The project uses Next.js showing a random Star Wars character every day using the SWAPI.
The character is shown on a card at the bottom of the screen. Additionally their homeworld / planet is marked on a custom Star Wars universe map
we created for this demo.
